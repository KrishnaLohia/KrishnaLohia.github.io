    I'm a second year commerce student at KC College, Mumbai. But the truth is I don't attend my online lectures instead I spend my time reading books(I like Non-Fiction), articles/blogs, learning on youtube or somewhere else also I work at an early stage Fintech Startup- Wint Wealth.

</p>
<p class="blocktext">
    I was always amazed by the startup world since I was in school(although I didn't know much it except that Jobs and Gates were the top entrepreneurs). And eventually started studying and reading more about the world of startup.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">    Then in April 2020 I got on Twitter and it introduced me to the Indian startup ecosystem and I got very interested instantly. That's where I found a community of a bunch of people like me who are very curious and excited about startups. It was end of December where I thought I should go work at a startup to really learn more about it.
</p>
<p class="blocktext">
    I'm currently interning at Wint Wealth an early stage fintech startup backed by investors like Kunal Shah, Nithin Kamath, Pravin Jadhav, etc. I got this internship through a cold email.
    </p>
    <p class="blocktext">
        At Wint Wealth, I'm working on various different things some key things I did there till now:
        <ul class="blocktext">
        <li>Grew the Twitter account from 0 to 4k in 3 months and LinkedIn to from 2k to 6k followers. </li>
        <li> Wrote blogs around financial education and also did the basic ground work for setting up Wintopedia(Wikipedia for Finance).</li> 
<li>Product Marketing(Changing About us and working on messaging).</li> 
<li>Working with PR agency on articles(writing everything that's going to be published) and branding and most important- Storytelling.</li>
A bunch of other things around Growth&Content.
</ul>
    </p>
    <p class="blocktext">
        I have also done a few <a href="/sideprojects.htm">side projects</a>  as I am exploring No-code.</p>
