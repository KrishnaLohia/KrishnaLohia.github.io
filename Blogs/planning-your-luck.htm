        <p class="blocktext">If you are a college student, you might find this worth your time.</p>
        <p class="blocktext"> After seeing <a href="/Krishna Lohia Website/Blogs/creating-an-opportunity-at-Fi.htm">this</a>, a couple of folks reached out to me and said it‚Äôs quite cool how I approached for an internship at Fi.</p>
        <p class="blocktext">Yesterday, I spoke to someone who told me this, "I had watched the Kunal Shah video too, where he shares this(see image below), but I took it as insight. I never thought someone would actually do it"</p>

        <p class="blocktext">This reminded me of mid-2020. Back then, I wanted to break into startups and do something, rather than sit at home and watch TV. So, I joined 2-3 communities and was soaking in all the advice that I got from people to break into startups which was:
            <ul class="blocktext">
                <li>Create Projects</li>
                <li>Cold Email/DM</li>
                <li>Start Something</li>
              </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="blocktext">However, instead of doing the things mentioned above, I watched videos of Naval, BeerBiceps, Warikoo, etc, scroll through tweets and listen to long hour podcasts. 
        </p>
        <p class="blocktext">(Now, it's reading countless blogs and summariesü•≤)
        </p>
        <p class="blocktext">After doing this, I used to say to myself that to break into startups, you need to create projects, cold mail people or start something. 
        </p>
        <p class="blocktext">But, the next day, I would repeat the same thing. It was an endless loop. 
        </p>
        <p class="blocktext">By end of 2020, I realised that all I‚Äôm doing is wishful thinking (very pleasing to imagine rather than doing something in reality). 
        </p>
        <p class="blocktext">(I still do this but I try to bring myself back to reality.)
        </p>
        <p class="blocktext">I decided to actually apply the insights that all the ‚Äúthought leaders‚Äù talked about. I started researching about startups, cold emailing folks for internships, etc and soon <a href="/Krishna Lohia Website/Blogs/how to get work or an internship at a startup.htm">landed a role.</a> </p>

        <p class="blocktext">So, what am I trying to say?
        </p>
        <p class="blocktext">If you are in the same place as I was, instead of consuming try to use the insights you find and actually do something. You will at least learn something from the experience, nothing there to lose :)
        </p>
        <p class="blocktext">(Also, this is a note to myself.)</p>

        <p class="blocktext">Thanks for reading! Feel free to DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/krishnalohiaaa">Twitter</a>, always up for a chat :))</p>
