      <ul class="blocktext">
        
      <li>Maintain a hypothesis/learning sheet</li> 
      <li>Hi-jack other people tweets
      </li> 
      <li>Look what other companies at your stage and the late stage is doing.
      </li> 
      <li>Speak the language which your user understands. And make it platform-specific.
      </li> 
      <li>Hygiene is important. Do it.
      </li> 
      <li>Do QnAâ€™s, people like that.
      </li> 
      <li>Giveaways(Do it the right way and you will have your target audience)
      </li> 
      <li>Experiment regularly whether through the style of content or new ideas.
      </li> 
      <li>Everyone likes bullet points.
      </li> 
      <li>Doing it consistently is important. Although, quality will surpass almost everything.
      </li> 
      <li>Aim for bringing spikes every day. You will have it at least once a week(This was advised to me and it works)
      </li> 
      <li>You have 1-2 sec(even less) to grab attention. Make the first line very powerful.
      </li> 
      <li>Make the last line(if long-form) extremely heavy, it should summarise the whole thing in 1 line as well as leave me with a very powerful insight.
      </li> 
      <li>Make your emails/features, shareworthy. This will bring a higher impact to your social media following.
      </li> 
      <li>Unscalable yet a method that works: Ask your friends to tag relevant influencers/big personalities on the post, if they reply your manager will be impressed. Of course, you donâ€™t need to do this when the page becomes big.
      </li> 
      <li>Try taking movies/series as an example to explain things. Brings a relatability factor and they form an image in mind, so they understand fast.
      </li> 
      <li>If you are going to announce something big(or even small), make an announcement about it. People get very curious and often engage or turn on notifs.
      </li> 
      <li>Try to keep it frictionless. For eg; if you want to make people comment on it make it easy for them so they can engage.
      </li> 
      <li>Donâ€™t ask the reader to do a bunch of tasks(follow, tag, etc), have one CTA. As cringe as AGREE? (At least itâ€™s clear)
      </li> 
      <li>Most of us like a sneak peek, whether itâ€™s about the product or the company or the people who work there.
      </li> 
      <li>Try video.
      </li> 
      <li>Make a counter content to what is usually written on the platform. Make fun of Linkedin on Linkedin.
</li> 
      <li>
        Post memes.
      </li> 
      <li>Steal like an artist.
      </li>
